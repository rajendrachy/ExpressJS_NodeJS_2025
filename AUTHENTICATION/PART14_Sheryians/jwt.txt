JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, secure way to transmit information between parties as a JSON object. It is commonly used for authentication.

It’s stateless: No need to store session data on the server.

It’s signed: So the server can verify it hasn't been tampered with.

A JWT typically contains:

Header: Algorithm & token type

Payload: Data (e.g., user ID)

Signature: Verifies token integrity
