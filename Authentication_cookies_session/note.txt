----------HTTP is Stateless & Sessions----------
HTTP is stateless → Each request is independent, server does not remember previous requests.

Problem: Without memory, things like login, shopping cart, user tracking are not possible.




-------------Session-------------
A session stores user data on the server to make HTTP stateful.

--------Process:--------
User logs in → Server creates session ID.
Session ID is sent to client (usually in a cookie).
Client sends session ID with every request.
Server retrieves user data from session storage.




----------Benefits-----------
Maintains login state.
Tracks shopping cart / user activity.
Secure (data stays on server).



---------- In short:--------------
HTTP = stateless
Session = makes it stateful by storing user info on server and using session ID.
