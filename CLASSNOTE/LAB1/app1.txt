Without using utf8 we get => buffer
=> The 'utf8' argument specifies the character encoding to be used when reading the file.

In computing, encoding refers to how characters (like letters, numbers, symbols) are represented as bytes (0s and 1s) so that they can be stored in a file or transmitted over the internet.

Encoding = the way text is turned into bytes and back.
'utf8' tells Node.js how to correctly interpret those bytes as human-readable text.
