-------------------- Authentication vs Authorization--------------------
------------Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. It answers the question:
ðŸ‘‰ "Are you really who you say you are?"

This usually happens through methods like:
Entering a username and password
Using an OTP (one-time password)
Logging in with Google, Facebook, etc. (OAuth)
Using biometrics like fingerprints or face ID

Once a user is successfully authenticated, the system knows who they are.











---------Authorization comes after authentication. It determines what actions or resources the authenticated user is allowed to access.
ðŸ‘‰ "Now that we know who you are, what are you allowed to do?"

This is usually handled through:
Role-based access control (e.g., admin, editor, user)
Permissions settings (e.g., canRead, canWrite)
Access policies defined by the app or API





------------------ Example Scenario:-------------------
A user logs into a website with their username and password â€” this is authentication.
Once logged in, the system checks whether that user has permission to access the admin dashboard â€” this is authorization.




-------------------Real-Life Analogy:--------------------------
Authentication is like showing your ID at the front door of a building.

Authorization is like being told which rooms you're allowed to enter inside the building.








-------------------- Relationship:--------------------
Authentication always comes before authorization.
You cannot be authorized if you haven't been authenticated.
