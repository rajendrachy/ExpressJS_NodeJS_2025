-------------------- Authentication vs Authorization--------------------
------------Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. It answers the question:
👉 "Are you really who you say you are?"

This usually happens through methods like:
Entering a username and password
Using an OTP (one-time password)
Logging in with Google, Facebook, etc. (OAuth)
Using biometrics like fingerprints or face ID

Once a user is successfully authenticated, the system knows who they are.











---------Authorization comes after authentication. It determines what actions or resources the authenticated user is allowed to access.
👉 "Now that we know who you are, what are you allowed to do?"

This is usually handled through:
Role-based access control (e.g., admin, editor, user)
Permissions settings (e.g., canRead, canWrite)
Access policies defined by the app or API









------------------ Example Scenario:-------------------
A user logs into a website with their username and password — this is authentication.
Once logged in, the system checks whether that user has permission to access the admin dashboard — this is authorization.




-------------------Real-Life Analogy:--------------------------
Authentication is like showing your ID at the front door of a building.

Authorization is like being told which rooms you're allowed to enter inside the building.










-------------------- Relationship:--------------------
Authentication always comes before authorization.
You cannot be authorized if you haven't been authenticated.
