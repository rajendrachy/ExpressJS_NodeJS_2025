What does it mean?
saveUninitialized: true
→ A new empty session will be created and saved in the store even if you don’t set any data in the session.
⚠️ This can cause lots of empty sessions stored in your memory/DB.

saveUninitialized: false
→ A session is not saved until something is actually stored in req.session.
✅ Recommended in most cases (saves resources, avoids GDPR/tracking issues).
