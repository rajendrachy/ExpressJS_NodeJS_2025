----------------Here’s the Express.js request lifecycle in short :------------------------
Client sends a request → Express receives it as req and res.
Middleware runs in order → logging, parsing, auth, etc.
Route matching → Express finds the matching route by path + method.
Route handler executes → business logic runs (DB calls, processing, etc.).
Response is sent → via res.send(), res.json(), etc.
Error/404 handling → if no route matches or error occurs.

------------------So basically:-----------------------
Request → Middleware → Route → Response → End ✅










---------------blocking vs non-blocking code---------------
Blocking code → Stops the event loop until it finishes → other requests must wait.
Non-blocking code → Doesn’t stop the event loop → frees it to handle other requests while waiting for I/O.
👉 In Express, always prefer non-blocking (async) code for better performance and scalability











#----------------The Common HTTP Methods----------------------
GET → Retrieve data
POST → Send new data (create)
PUT → Update/replace an existing resource
PATCH → Update/modify part of a resource
DELETE → Remove a resource
(Less common but still valid) OPTIONS, HEAD
